This allows you to toggle tracing on and off without changing your code.Additionally, you will need to set the LANGCHAIN_API_KEY environment variable to your API key (see Setup for more information).By default, the traces will be logged to a project named default.\\nTo log traces to a different project, see this section. \\n\\n\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"To set up tracing to LangSmith using the `@traceable` decorator in Python, first ensure that you have the `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2` environment variable set to 'true' and the `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` set to your API key. Then, you can simply decorate your functions like this:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom langsmith import traceable\\n\\n@traceable\\ndef my_function():\\n    # Your code here\\n    pass\\n```\\n\\nThis will log traces for `my_function` automatically once the necessary environment variables are configured.\"\n",

This is because Python's asyncio only added full support for passing context in version 3.11.\\nWhy‚Äã\\nLangChain and LangSmith SDK use contextvars to propagate tracing information implicitly. In Python 3.11 and above, this works seamlessly. However, in earlier versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10), asyncio tasks lack proper contextvar support, which can lead to disconnected traces.\\nTo resolve‚Äã\\n\\nContext propagation using threading‚Äã\\nIt's common to start tracing and want to apply some parallelism on child tasks all within a single trace. Python's stdlib ThreadPoolExecutor by default breaks tracing.\\nWhy‚Äã\\nPython's contextvars start empty within new threads. Here are two approaches to handle maintain trace contiguity:\\nTo resolve‚Äã\\n\\n\\nUsing LangSmith's ContextThreadPoolExecutor\\nLangSmith provides a ContextThreadPoolExecutor that automatically handles context propagation:\\nfrom langsmith.utils import ContextThreadPoolExecutorfrom langsmith import traceable@traceabledef outer_func():    with ContextThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:        inputs = [1, 2]        r = list(executor.map(inner_func, inputs))@traceabledef inner_func(x):    print(x)outer_func()\\n\\n\\nManually providing the parent run tree\\nAlternatively, you can manually pass the parent run tree to the inner function:\\nfrom langsmith import traceable, get_current_run_treefrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor@traceabledef outer_func():    rt = get_current_run_tree()    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:        r = list(            executor.map(                lambda x: inner_func(x, langsmith_extra={\\\"parent\\\": rt}), [1, 2]            )        )@traceabledef inner_func(x):    print(x)outer_func()\\nIn this approach, we use get_current_run_tree() to obtain the current run tree and pass it to the inner function using the langsmith_extra parameter. \\n\\n \"\"\",\n",
